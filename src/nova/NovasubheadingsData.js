              The objective of this project is to recreate my previous AI model onto a Rasberry pi, I will also 3d print a head model to house all of the recquired components.

            Nova is an Ai assistant, It essitnally functions like alexa. I will recreate it on a rasberry pi I will also add an Audio Codec Hat to function as the mic and speaker for Nova. The second part of the project will be creating a head model on blender to 3d print this will act as the holding case of all working components.

            The first half of this project I had to recreate My previous AI model by downloading py charm on the rasberry pi

             The second part of this project was making a model on blender and then printing it out with my Ender 3. I had to also make sure the model was big enough to fit all of the components, it also has to be stong enough to protect said components.

              After everything was in place I relized that the speakers had an echo which I did not account for, I also want to make the AI constaltly awake as of right now I have to open up pycharm and then I have to run the program to get make my AI functioanal. I am more inclined to use Nova as a simple bluetooth speaker because it doesnt recquire me to hook it up to a monitor. A link to this project presentation is provided in my projects section.
