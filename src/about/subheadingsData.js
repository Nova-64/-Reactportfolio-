                        After getting my Associate degree I went on to complete my Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering Technology. The program gave me a much deeper dive into some of the areas I had touched on while completing my associates. The things I learned helped me succeed during my time working in the lab and in helping me develop the several projects I have made away from the classroom.

                        I was able to get my Computer Science associate degree from New York City College of Technology. The program provided me with the first two years of study leading to a baccalaureate degree in computer engineering technology. I was able to learn about Logic, Problem-Solving, and CAD. The program gave me the ability to design solutions for well-defined technical problems and assist with the engineering design of systems, components, or processes appropriate to the discipline.

                        From March 2022 to June 2023, I worked at Streamline Dental Lab as a Dental Technician. I was responsible for making crowns and  3D impressions. I was also responsible for sending both the physical and 3D impressions to our corresponding lab in China. Additionally, I ensured the lab's files were accurate and I sent designated tickets to different department heads regarding individual lab cases.
